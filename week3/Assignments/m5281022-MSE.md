### Explanation of Mean and Variance as Optimal Choices for MSE

In the context of mean squared error (MSE), we consider a random variable $Y$ with mean $\mu_Y$ and variance $\sigma_Y^2$. When choosing a constant $c$ to approximate $Y$, we define the MSE as the expected squared deviation of $Y$ from $c$:
$$
\operatorname{MSE} = \mathbb{E}\left\{(Y - c)^2\right\}.
$$

Our goal is to find the value of $c$ that minimizes this MSE. By minimizing this expected squared deviation, we aim to find the "best" constant approximation of $Y$ in terms of its expected distance from $Y$.

### Why the Mean Minimizes MSE

1. **Expanding the MSE Expression**: 
   To find the optimal $c$, we expand the expression for MSE:
   $$
   \operatorname{MSE} = \mathbb{E}[(Y - c)^2] = \mathbb{E}[Y^2 - 2Yc + c^2].
   $$
   Since $\mathbb{E}[Y] = \mu_Y$, we can rewrite this as:
   $$
   \operatorname{MSE} = \mathbb{E}[Y^2] - 2c\mu_Y + c^2.
   $$

2. **Differentiating with Respect to $c$**: 
   To minimize MSE, we differentiate with respect to $c$ and set the result to zero:
   $$
   \frac{d}{dc} \operatorname{MSE} = -2\mu_Y + 2c = 0.
   $$
   Solving this equation gives $c = \mu_Y$. Therefore, the optimal choice of $c$ to minimize MSE is the mean of $Y$, $\mu_Y$.

3. **Resulting MSE as Variance**:
   When $c = \mu_Y$, the MSE becomes:
   $$
   \operatorname{MSE}(\mu_Y) = \mathbb{E}[(Y - \mu_Y)^2] = \sigma_Y^2,
   $$
   which is exactly the variance of $Y$.

Thus, we see that:
- **The mean $\mu_Y$ is the best constant choice $c$** in terms of minimizing MSE.
- **The minimum MSE achievable is equal to the variance $\sigma_Y^2$**, representing the inherent variability of $Y$ around its mean.

### Summary

The mean and variance of $Y$ are optimal in the context of MSE because:
- The mean $\mu_Y$ minimizes the expected squared deviation, making it the most accurate constant approximation of $Y$.
- The variance $\sigma_Y^2$ quantifies the "best possible error" when approximating $Y$ by its mean.

This result aligns with the general properties of expectation and variance for random variables and reinforces the interpretation of variance as a measure of dispersion around the mean.
